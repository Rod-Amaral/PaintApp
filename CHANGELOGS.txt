- Parity check system now working,
If a parity error is found, the two previous data packets are asked to be sent again,
so the the wrong data packet isn't sent after a data packet it was ment to be sent before.

logic:
parity error-> packet denied-> another packet possibly is sent in between ->
-> denied
packet is sent again-> the packet in between is sent again, so correct order is perserved

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
