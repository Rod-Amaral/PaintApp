- Now instead of setting each pixel individually, to paint on the Image,
I'm using QPainter to paint on the Image with the selected pen
- Cleaned up code, Optimized a few things.


NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.

Maybe instead of painting on every mouse coordinate got form the event,
paint a line between the current mouse event coordinate, and the last.
This of cours eisn't ideal, but the current solution stil can't keep up with very fast mouse movements!
