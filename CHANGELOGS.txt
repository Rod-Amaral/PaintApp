- Can only paint using Left mouse button now
- Now Displaying a settings menu when right cliking on MainWindow
- Now capable of Resizing the windows correctly, with resize event
- some bugs fixed

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
