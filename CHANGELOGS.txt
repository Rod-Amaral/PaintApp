- Re-worked / added some Slots and Signals functions, for clear communication later on
- Now sending QPoint positions and paint Point/Line commands with a binary boolean system
- developed a OP code system, where the first 3 bits sent, represent an operation to be done with the data sent afterwards
- Some bugs to be fixed, still can't close window / clear Screen with new system

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
