- Fixed bug where it would crash on reseting the QImage, while SendBCP thread was activated.
- Seperated Main and Child Window classes code, to simulate like both windows were runnig on 2 Pis

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
