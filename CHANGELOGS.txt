- Created two thread classes for sending and receiving in the BCP
- Implemented multithreading for the BCP
- Cleaned up code, added a few statics and consts there and there
- Re-did comments

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
