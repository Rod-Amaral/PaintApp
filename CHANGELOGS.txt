- Implemented QThread support, for painting to Images on both windows
- Added space for side menu
- Prevented from painting to an Image of both windows, at the same time,
this is probably temporary, may not be needed if both windows are on seperate threads.
- Now using Slots and Signals to close chils window, instead of QObject parent-child system

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
