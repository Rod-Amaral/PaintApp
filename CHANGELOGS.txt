- replaced the coordinate function for a Qpoint again, for S&S signal in ChildWindow subclass
- Replaced the 2D array of booleans, with a QImage of the window size
- Now mouse events set the Image pixels around the event coords,
- Paint event paints such Image


NOTES:
QPainter is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
