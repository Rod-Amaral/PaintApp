- Parameterized some values, like window size
- Created 2D Pixel map of booleans, where I store where mouse coordinates to where user mouse has been / pressed
- Now instead of sending a QPoint to the child window, the program sends two integers, x and y, of a mouse event coordinates
- PaintEvent function, now goes through the Pixel map, and looks for point to where to draw
- Made it so it ignored mouse event coordinates, outside the window size
- Removed toggle variable, no longer needed

PROBLEMS / BUGS

- Paint event is slow, It can't keep up with fast mouse movements, so not all corrdinates are painted
- Giving an array of coordinates to paint, may be faster
