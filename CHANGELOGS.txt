- Now, Painting between current mouse coordinate, and stored LasPoint on mouseMove event
- Turned on AntiAliasing, on painting to the Image, and To the Window
- Made it roundpen
- Fixed bugs


NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
