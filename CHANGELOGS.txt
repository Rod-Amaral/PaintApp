- Made second window work properly
- Removed check for mouse coordinates to be inside the window, no longer needed
- Now both windows can be cleared by pressing the R key
- Reorganized a bit the functions used for Signals and Slots and Mechanism
Now the ChildWindow only has slots functions, and MainWindow has the signal functions on top
- Added some comments

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
