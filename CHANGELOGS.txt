- Resizing is working, everything seems nominal now with new BCP mechanism

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
