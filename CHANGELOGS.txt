- Can now sync the Child window with main window, if the child window is different form the main window,
takes a while, but this is achieved by sending individual pixel data,
this can be use for when the child window has an error / load image files

NOTES:
QImage is optmimized for I/O, great!
Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto images.
When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread than the current GUI thread.
